# TensorFlow Model for UK Census Data

A simple TensorFlow application to get to grips with neural networks.  Based on the TensorFlow example at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide

## Data Used

UK Census Microdata Teaching file available from the Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census/2011censusdata/censusmicrodata/microdatateachingfile

This file contains 1% percent of the census data - approximately 500,000 records.


## Python Setup

* Install TensorFlow following the instructions: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
* Create virtualenv:
```virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/Web-Projects/TensorFlow```
* Activate the virtualenv: ```source bin/activate```

*TODO* : Lots... just a work in progress learning project at the moment.
